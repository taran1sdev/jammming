Codecademy Front End Engineer Path project using ReactJS.

I created a backend API with Go to handle requests to the Spotify API instead of doing everything on the frontend.

Application Features:
- Authenticate with spotify api
- Search for tracks
- Play/Pause tracks that appear in search
- Build a playlist
- Name the playlist
- Upload the Playlist to spotify profile

TODO:
- Make design more responsive
